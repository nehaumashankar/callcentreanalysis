# Call Centre Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates a call centre performance analysis through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides valuable insights into various performance metrics, including call volume, issue resolution rates, call response times, call lengths, and customer satisfaction trends over a three-month period. Created as part of a job simulation with PwC Switzerland, this analysis highlights both technical and analytical skills in data visualization, focusing on client needs for actionable insights.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of long-term trends in customer and call centre agent performance. By analyzing these metrics, the dashboard aids in identifying areas for improvement in response time, customer satisfaction, and agent productivity.

## Key Features
## Dashboard KPIs:
**Calls Answered/Abandoned:** Tracks the total volume of calls answered or abandoned over the selected time frame.
**Issue Resolution:** Measures the total number of issues resolved, highlighting agent effectiveness.
**Average Speed of Answer (SOA):** Captures the average response time, indicating efficiency in customer service.
**Call Length:** Shows average call duration to gauge efficiency and quality.
**Customer Satisfaction Rate:** Overall satisfaction rating for each agent, derived from customer feedback.
**Agent Performance Quadrant:** Compares agent metrics like issue resolution and satisfaction rating in a quadrant layout, helping identify top-performing agents.
**Monthly Trends:** Visualizes call volume, issue resolution, and satisfaction trends over the January to March 2021 period.

## Tools Used
**Power BI:** Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
**Power Query:** Applied for data cleaning, transformation, and integration.

## Dataset
The data covers three months of call centre activity from January to March 2021. Key fields include:

**Agent Name:** Name of each call centre agent.
**Calls Answered:** Total calls each agent answered.
**Issues Resolved:** Total issues resolved by each agent.
**Avg Satisfaction Rating:** Average customer satisfaction score for each agent.
**SOA (Speed of Answer):** Average time taken to respond to calls, measured in seconds.

## Insights & Findings
**Call Volume and Response Times:** Higher call volumes led to slight increases in response time, affecting customer satisfaction.
**Agent Performance:** The performance quadrant effectively highlights high and low performers based on issue resolution rates and satisfaction scores.
**Satisfaction Trends:** A steady satisfaction rate shows consistent agent performance, with minor dips during peak call volumes.

## Using the Dashboard
**Date Filters:** Adjust the date range to focus on specific months or periods.
**Agent Filters:** Filter data by individual agents to view detailed performance metrics.
**KPI Panels:** Explore each KPI panel for insights on customer satisfaction, average response times, and issue resolution.
